# AES in PHP
- This is a PHP version of AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). 
- This PHP version is a server-side complement to the JavaScript AES implementation.
- This version directly mirrors the JavaScript version; it differs in that PHP has Base64 encoding and UTF-8 encoding built-in, and has no unsigned-right-shift operator(!), but is otherwise a straightforward port, with syntactic differences and differently-named library functions.
- An explanation of the operation of the algorithm is given with the JavaScript version.
