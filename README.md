# AES in PHP
- This is a PHP version of AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). 
- This PHP version is a server-side complement to the JavaScript AES implementation.
- This version directly mirrors the JavaScript version; it differs in that PHP has Base64 encoding and UTF-8 encoding built-in, and has no unsigned-right-shift operator(!), but is otherwise a straightforward port, with syntactic differences and differently-named library functions.
- An explanation of the operation of the algorithm is given with the JavaScript version.


# AES 256-bit Encryption vs 128-bit
```
The current encryption standard for most government and private sector IT 
security purposes is called the Advanced Encryption System.  AES was chosen as 
the U.S. government security standard in 2001, and eventually also evolved into
the encryption standard for most private sector enterprises.

AES uses a symmetric algorithm, which means the same key is applied for both 
encryption and decryption. The algorithm provides 128-bit block encryption and 
has been designed to supports key sizes of 128, 192 and 256 bits. AES 256-bit 
encryption is the strongest and most robust encryption standard that is 
commercially available today.

While it is theoretically true that AES 256-bit encryption is harder to crack 
than AES 128-bit encryption, AES 128-bit encryption has never been cracked. 
Furthermore, it would take many, many years to cover all of the possibilities 
generated by 128-bit encryption, so it is not likely to be cracked in the near 
future. That said, AES 256-bit encryption is the strongest encryption standard 
available, so you might as well use it if you have enough processing power.

256-bit encryption was not commonly used when the AES standards were first 
introduced in 2000, as using 256-bit encryption caused slower execution speeds 
in most networks given the higher processing demands. However, most devices 
today have much faster processors, and using 256-bit encryption does not 
typically slow down job execution significantly.

Idera SQL products are designed so you can choose the encryption level. 
You are prompted to choose 128-bit, 256-bit or no encryption as a default 
during installation, but you can switch encryption levels at any time.
